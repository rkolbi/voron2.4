****Voron 2.4 Configuration with Tap, Sensorless X&Y Homing, EBB36 w/U2C, and Cpap part cooling****  
------

This Klipper configuration is tailored for the Voron 2.4 3D printer with Tap, offering a range of features to optimize your printing experience. Here's an overview of the key enhancements:

**Macro File Management:**

The configuration simplifies file management by automatically pulling all ".cfg" files from the ACTIVE directory while excluding any files in the INACTIVE directory. You can conveniently move and edit files using Samba or other networking file-share services as if they were on your desktop. To exclude a file from Klipper, rename its extension within the ACTIVE directory (e.g., "do_stuff.cfg" to "do_stuff.cfgno"), or move it to the INACTIVE directory. Please refer to the instructions below if you require assistance setting up Samba network sharing.

**printer.cfg:**

The root directory includes a "printer.cfg" file that loads all ".cfg" files from the ACTIVE directory. It also serves as a centralized location for modifying global variables used by the included macros. Additionally, any saved parameters generated by Klipper are stored at the bottom of the "printer.cfg" file for easy access and management.

**Printer-Specific Configurations:**

To accommodate printer-specific settings, you can create a dedicated file such as "CONFIG-VORON24_350.cfg" (feel free to choose a different name if preferred). This configuration file is specific to your Voron 2.4 printer, allowing you to organize the contents further. Remember that "printer.cfg" automatically loads all ".cfg" files from the ACTIVE directory, irrespective of their names. Therefore, it's crucial to use meaningful and portable filenames to ensure ease of use and future compatibility.<br>

### Configuration Bundle Highlights
------


#### **PRINT_START macro**:

1. Automation: The PRINT_START macro automates multiple steps before starting a print, such as heat soaking, toolhead warming, gantry homing, and leveling. 
2. Heat-soak cycle: The macro includes a heat-soak cycle that allows the printer to stabilize its temperature before starting the actual print. This cycle is crucial for ensuring that the printer operates at the desired temperature, which is essential for successful printing and proper filament adhesion.
3. Gantry homing and leveling: As the heat-soak cycle begins, the PRINT_START macro also performs gantry homing and leveling. This step prevents any undue stress on the gantry as chamber temperatures rise, ensuring that the gantry remains properly aligned.
4. Flexibility: The heat-soak cycle can be terminated early by selecting RESUME or executing the WAIT_QUIT macro. This flexibility allows users to abort the heat-soak cycle if needed, for example, when encountering unexpected issues or when wanting to start the print sooner.
5. Adaptive Mesh: The PRINT_START macro incorporates the use of Adaptive Mesh, which improves bed leveling and compensates for any imperfections in the printing surface within the print area of the object itself. This step enhances the first-layer adhesion and overall print quality by adjusting the printing parameters based on the actual surface conditions.
6. Purge line and pressure advance proof: The macro includes a purge line and a simple line-based pressure advance proof. The purge line allows users to verify key aspects of the printer's performance, such as filament flow and pressure advance, ensuring that the printer is functioning correctly before starting the actual print.

Overall, the advantages of the PRINT_START macro lie in its automation of critical steps, gantry leveling, and temperature stabilization, flexibility in terminating the heat-soak cycle, the inclusion of Adaptive Mesh for improved bed leveling, and simplified verification of key printer parameters. These advantages contribute to a streamlined and efficient workflow, enhancing print quality and user experience.


The **Start G-code** block in SuperSlicer should contain the following line:

```
PRINT_START BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature] EXTRUDER_TEMP=[first_layer_temperature] EXTRUDER_TEMP2=[temperature] ENCLOSURE_TEMP=[chamber_temperature] PA=0.045 ST=0.21 SIZE={first_layer_print_min[0]}{first_layer_print_min[1]}{first_layer_print_max[0]}_{first_layer_print_max[1]}
```

The following optional parameters can be specified, or the values set in "printer.cfg" will be used:

- **PA**: Pressure advance, e.g., `PA=0.045`
- **ST**: Pressure advance smooth-time, e.g., `ST=0.21`
- **SOAK**: Minutes to heat-soak before final G32, meshing, and printing, e.g., `SOAK=15`
- **ENCLOSURE_TEMP**: The desired temperature for enclosure control (if enabled)
<br>  

#### **LC_PAUSE (Layer Change) macro:**

1. Convenience: The LC_PAUSE macro provides a simple and user-friendly mechanism for controlling the "Pause on the next layer" functionality. This functionality allows users to pause the printing process at a specific layer and perform certain actions or make adjustments as needed.
2. Flexibility: The macro allows flexibility in how the pause functionality is applied. Users can either pause at the next layer change by not specifying a specific layer value or trigger a pause only when a specific layer number is passed as a parameter to the macro. This flexibility caters to different use cases and allows users to customize the behavior according to their requirements.
3. Dynamic behavior: The LC_PAUSE macro considers the current state of the "Pause on the next layer" flag. If LC_PAUSE has already been set, executing the macro will toggle it off, effectively canceling the pause. This dynamic behavior ensures that users have control over the pause functionality and can easily modify it during runtime without complications.
4. Integration with slicer functionality: The macro integrates with the slicer's layer change mechanism by checking the slicer's passed layer value and comparing it with the user's specified layer. This integration enhances the compatibility and interoperability between the macro and the slicer, resulting in a more seamless workflow when managing layer-based pausing in a slicer environment.

Overall, the advantages of the LC_PAUSE macro lie in its convenience, flexibility, dynamic behavior, and integration with slicer functionality, making it a helpful tool for managing layer-based pausing in a slicer environment.

The **After Layer Change G-code** block in SuperSlicer should contain the following to enable the Pause on the next Layer Change (LC_PAUSE) command:

```
_LAYER_CHANGE LAYER={layer_num}
```

<br>  

#### **PRINT_END macro:**

1. Print clearance: When completed, the PRINT_END macro raises the toolhead by 10mm to prevent the nozzle from scarring or damaging the finished print. This step helps maintain the quality and appearance of the printed object, preventing accidental contact between the nozzle and the print.
2. Cooling activation: The macro activates the part cooling fan to 100% after the print is finished. This helps cool down the hotend and reduces the chances of stringing or unwanted filament deposits that can occur when the nozzle remains hot after the print has ended.
3. Toolhead parking: The macro parks the toolhead towards the printer's top, in the front-right position. This parking position is strategically chosen to provide optimal accessibility for visual inspection of the toolhead and nozzle, making it easier to identify and clean any debris or filament residue that may have accumulated during the print.
4. Fan clearance: The macro moves the toolhead back to Y20, allowing the fans to pull air without being obstructed by the printer's doors. This step ensures proper airflow and cooling efficiency by preventing obstructions that may impede the fans' ability to circulate air effectively and cool down the printer components.
5. Safety and maintenance: The actions performed by the PRINT_END macro contribute to the safety and maintenance aspects of 3D printing. Raising the toolhead reduces the risk of accidental damage or interference with the printed object when removing it from the build plate. Activating cooling helps prevent overheating of the printer components, which can lead to premature wear or malfunction. Parking the toolhead in a suitable position allows for easy inspection and cleaning, enhancing the longevity and reliability of the printer and preparing it for the next print job.

Overall, the advantages of the PRINT_END macro lie in its print clearance, cooling activation, toolhead parking at an accessible position, and fan clearance for proper airflow. These advantages ensure a smooth and efficient end to the print job while promoting print quality, user convenience, and printer longevity.

The **End G-code** block in SuperSlicer should contain the following line:

```
PRINT_END
```

#### **PA_CAL (Pressure Advance) macro:**

1. Simplified Pressure Advance Testing: The PA_CAL macro enables users to perform a quick, straightforward, line-based pressure advance test. It prints a line with the current pressure advance (PA) setting, moves 30mm, and then prints 20 line segments, each 5mm apart, incrementing the PA value for each line. This simplified testing process allows users to quickly assess and fine-tune their pressure advance settings more efficiently, leading to improved print quality.
2. Customizable Parameters: The macro supports optional parameters for adjusting the test conditions. Users can specify the bed temperature (BED), extruder temperature (EXTRUDER_TEMP), initial PA value (PA_START), PA increment (PA_STEP), and nozzle diameter (NZL). This customization allows users to tailor the test conditions to their specific requirements and experiment with different settings, facilitating optimization.
3. Default Values: If no parameters are specified, the macro provides default values for the optional parameters. These default values are retrieved from the printer's configuration file or other global variables, ensuring users can perform the test without specifying all the parameters. This feature makes the macro more user-friendly and accessible.
4. Test Validation: The macro provides a mechanism to validate the test results by comparing the estimated PA threshold value with the user-specified PA threshold. This validation step helps users accurately identify the optimal PA setting and ensure reliable and consistent results during the pressure advance tuning process.

Overall, the advantages of the PA_CAL macro lie in its simplified pressure advance testing, customizable parameters, default values, and test validation. These features facilitate the optimization of pressure advance settings, allowing users to achieve better print quality and performance in their 3D prints.

### **Notes on CAN**
------

**Solving Excessive CAN0 RX Errors, running rPi4 64bit, Klipper latest 64bit**  
*-Linux 5.15.84-v8+ #1613 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jan 5 12:03:08 GMT 2023 aarch64 GNU/Linux*  
*-WaveShare RS485 CAN HAT for Raspberry Pi - 12M crystal*  

I got many daily RX errors (`ip -details -statistics link show can0`). While not showing any errors in Klipper, I suffered a communication timeout error twice over the past few days. Through some internet diving, SPI speeds with 64bit OS are an issue, suggesting they are about halved and change based on the core speed of the rPi. I think this situation was made worse by WaveShare's documentation to set `spimaxfrequency=2000000`. As of now, I have been RX error free by using the following @ bitrate of 1,000,000.  

:zap:*Please research these changes before implementing them, as I am no rPi expert - just letting you know what worked for me.*  
<br>  
To get the WaveShare canhat working properly, I set these in ` /boot/config.txt`  
```
dtparam=spi=on  
dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=12000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=10000000  
dtoverlay=spi0-hw-cs  
enable_uart=0  
```

And also set `/etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` as:  
```
auto can0  
iface can0 can static  
 bitrate 1000000  
 up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 256  
 pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000  
 pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 256  
```

<br>

<br>

May be related to WaveShare success - not sure, I lock my speed to 1200000 by adding the following to `/boot/config.txt`  
```
arm_freq=1200  
core_freq=500  
core_freq_min=500  
```

And made the following changes to `/etc/rc.local`  
```
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true  
if [ "$_IP" ]; then  
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"  
fi  
iwconfig wlan0 power off  
echo "performance" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor  
exit 0  
```

### **SAMBA Setup - GCODE File Network Share Setup**
------

To set up a network file share, making your gcode and Klipper config files available to all your network-attached devices - either Windows or Mac file explorers, perform the following once ssh'd into your Klipper rPi. Note that this samba configuration is 'open' and therefore accessible to any device attached to the same LAN, just as the Mainsail HTTP interface is. While it is possible to restrict access to these Samba file shares, I feel it is a moot point given the nature of the rest of the software suite, so I will not cover that here. If this is worrisome to you, please research alternate configurations. 

 -Install file serving smb service:  
$`sudo apt-get install samba winbind -y`  

 -Configure file share.  Add the following to the end of the smb.conf file:  
$`sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf`  
	
```
[Print_Files]  
   comment = Voron_gCode_files  
   path = /home/pi/printer_data/gcodes  
   browseable = Yes  
   writeable = Yes  
   only guest = no  
   create mask = 0777  
   directory mask = 0777  
   public = yes  
   read only = no  
   force user = root  
   force group = root  

[Klipper_Configs]  
   comment = Voron_Klipper  
   path = /home/pi/printer_data/config  
   browseable = Yes  
   writeable = Yes  
   only guest = no  
   create mask = 0777  
   directory mask = 0777  
   public = yes  
   read only = no  
   force user = root  
   force group = root  

[Klipper_Storage]
   comment = Voron_Storage
   path = /home/pi/Storage
   browseable = Yes
   writeable = Yes
   only guest = no
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   public = yes
   read only = no
   force user = root
   force group = root
```



 -Reboot rPi:  
$`sudo reboot`  
	

In the event that Windows shows a red-x through the mapped share, I have found the following helpful in restoring mapped network shares:  
- Run `CMD` as administrator  
- `net stop workstation /y`  
- `net start workstation`
